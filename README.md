# wailmer-ubuntu
An attempt at making the Spheal/hb-appstore dependency installation process painless.

Also, only run on Ubuntu/WSL Ubuntu.
Stuff would probably go wrong if you ran this on something like msys2, arch, etc. (Debian should work though)

To run, do:

```
wget https://github.com/something/iforgor.sh
chmod +x ./wailmer-ubuntu.sh
sudo ./wailmer-ubuntu.sh
```
