# This is a (trimmed and fixed) dependency helper script to help set up requirements for running make
# primarly this script is used by the CI, but is also useful when setting up a new env

# Before running it, you should export the desired PLATFORM environment
# variable ( one of pc, pc-sdl1, switch, 3ds, wii, wiiu, all )
#  eg. PLATFORM=switch ./dependency_helper.sh

# this script should work when ran on these OSes:
#   - archlinux (uses native pacman)
#   - ubuntu:18.04 w/ dkp-pacman (flakey)
# (aka, if you have either pacman or apt-get already)
# TODO: add macOS, WSL (windows), and fedora builds using $OSTYPE checks

# It's probably better to follow the README.md instructions for the
# desired target and platform that you want to build, but this may
# help if you are interested in seeing how the dependencies come together
# on various platforms, or how the CI works

  # To any dkP staff that may be reading this: Why don't you want developers to use their own scripts for their own CI?
  # if it's a bandwidth issue, let's talk, because hosting static resources (like pacman repos) should not be incurring bandwidth charges
  # For instance, hb-appstore is statically hosted, and processes several hundred GB a month with no concern about how much bandwidth we use
  # (in fact, we're happy to see more downloads!) so I really can't understand the motive behind this move other than to control CI scripts

  # In my opinion, this absolutely contradicts the usefulness provided by the pacman repos, and pushes devs towards alternative solutions
  # such as using leseratte's historical archives of your tools, or wanting to host their own mirrors
  # Instance of dkP staff disdain for build scripts: https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues/739

  # We build for many different platforms and want to have control our own CI images that we build in (a very reasonable desire!)
  # I like shell scripts, they are effective and frequently used in CI across the board, and work on most operating systems (including windows!)
  # It's not dkP staff's concern if they don't like the way that we're building our own packages, happy to talk more about this

  # Also happy to offer assistance mirroring or rehosting your packages under unconstrained bandwidth!
